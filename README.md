# permcolors
Better permissions page readability via color coding, for Drupal 9 and 10. 

## Issue
The permissions page presents a long list of checkboxes that can be checked, unchecked, 
or disabled for any given ROLE. This important administrative page is often difficult 
to read and make sense of when setting up or updating permissions.

## Solution
The PermColors module applies clear and easy to understand color coded readability using 
GREEN/RED and LIGHT/DARK color coding to clearly indicate each ROLEs permission statuses, 
as well as how you may be modifying them upon hitting SAVE.

## Caveats
The PermColors module is designed to work with the two standard Drupal 9 and Drupal 10 
admin themes "seven" and "claro". Note that non-standard Drupal admin themes may have 
customizations to the permissions page HTML that result in the color coding not being 
applied.
